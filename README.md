# Legend-of-Link

https://gonczarm.github.io/Legend-of-Link/

This was the first project I was able to build using only JavaScript. I grew up playing many iterations of Legend of Zelda and wanted to emulate it. This game lets you control and move Link around the map. You share the map with many ghosts that will attack when you cross their path. You can, however, try and defeat the enemies by swinging your sword at them.

## Technology 

This application us built strictly using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The libraries I used to help make it possible were jQuery and Canvas

## User Stories

### MVP

1. User spawns in middle of map
2. User can move, with specific keyboard keys WASD, around the designated area of the map
3. Enemies spawn in specific locations and move in a square around map
4. If User collides with an enemy, user dies and game ends
5. User attacks enemies with sword by hitting spacebar
6. an attack extends sword in direction user moves
7. if enemy is in the sword, enemy is destroyed
8. If user destroyes all enemies on screen user wins
9. sound for music, and different animation

### Extras

1. User has a health of 3 hearts
2. Above the screen a display is shown of users hearts
3. Each collision with enemy takes away a heart from the user
4. if user loses all hearts game ends
5. if user defeats all enemies a boss appears
6. boss follows user around trying to collide with user to deal damage

### Stretch

3. after killing enemy, enemy will drop rupee
4. add rupee count to display
